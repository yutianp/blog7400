          Pluspy <br>
          Pluspy is a low budget 1987 film that many credit with launching the popular drifting scene in Japan, from there it caught on in the USA and further afield, and today it’s one of the fastest growing forms of motorsport in the world.

          The concept of power-sliding a car through corners was far from new in the 1980s, but as a form of motorsport in and of itself it was new – and it’s widely believed that it was invented by Kunimitsu Takahashi of Japan. Takahashi’s most famous disciple is Keiichi Tsuchiya – a driver with wins and significant performances in various motorsport disciples from Le Mans endurance driving to NASCAR, the Japanese Formula Three Championship, and the Japanese Touring Car Championship.

          In ’87 the legend of Tsuchiya’s street racing style had grown to the point that a number of popular Japanese car magazines and tuning garages agreed to produce a video of Tsuchiya’s drifting skills on a mountain pass.<br>

          Machine Hallucination <br>
          Refik Anadol's work has always fascinated me in which he uses generative art through ai and machine learning to create lucid yet dreamlike imagery. It creates a feeling like we are watching a machine's memories or dreams being projected into something almost tangible. I want to be able to also utilise machine learning in some way to create some sort of imagery which morphs inbetween my personal relation with cars.
